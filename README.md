# 21PWBCS0840-WP-Fall23
 Begin by studying Git from slides no. 67-80 from lecture 01 to understand the fundamentals of version control 
and the basics of Git.
• Create a GitHub repository with the format "Reg_No.-WP-Fall23" to manage your project.
• Initialize a README.md file in the repository with a concise task description.
• Commit and push a sample code file to your GitHub repository to demonstrate version control in action.
• Initialize Git in your local development environment.
• Clone your GitHub repository to your local machine.
• Create a branch named "CS-311 Web Programming" in your GitHub repository to work on new features or 
changes separately from the main/master branch.
• Create a new branch "Software Engineering" locally assume to work on another aspect of your task.
• Add one to two of your classmates as collaborators to your GitHub repository.
• Allow them to add, delete, and update files in the repository.
• Make changes to your code in the "CS-311 Web Programming" branch, stage them, and commit with a 
descriptive message. Use version control to track changes and coordinate with collaborators.
• Merge the "CS-311 Web Programming" branch into the "main/master" branch once your changes are tested and 
completed.
• Delete the remote "Software Engineering" branch.
• Demonstrate how to record the history of modifications made by your classmates:
- Use version control features to view commit history.
- Show how to view individual commits to understand changes
